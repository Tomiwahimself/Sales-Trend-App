Introduction  

Welcome to the documentation for the Sales Trend Analysis App, a project I've developed to analyse historical sales data and provide insights into trends, patterns, and seasonality. This project is designed to make data-driven decision-making easier, by automating the analysis process and offering predictive capabilities. 

  

Problem Statement 

In the world of business, understanding sales trends and patterns is crucial for making informed decisions. However, traditional manual analysis methods are time-consuming and can lead to oversight of important insights. Additionally, predicting future sales trends accurately is a complex task that often requires specialized knowledge. 

  

Solution 

The Sales Trend Analysis App is designed to address these challenges by providing an automated and intuitive platform for sales data analysis. Leveraging the power of AI and machine learning, the app offers the following features: 

1. Data Preprocessing: The app loads and preprocesses sales data, saving time and ensuring accurate analysis. 

2. Interactive Visualization: Visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, and box plots, allow for easy interpretation of trends and patterns. 

3. Insightful Analysis: The app calculates metrics such as average sales trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations, providing valuable insights. 

4. Predictive Analytics: Utilizing the ARIMA model, the app forecasts future sales trends, along with mean squared error and accuracy categorization. 

5. User-Friendly Interface: With a sidebar for user input and interactive sections, the app makes navigation and analysis seamless. 

 How to Use 

1. Data Loading: The app loads pre-processed sales data.  
Note: The 'Date' column is automatically converted to datetime format. 

2. Exploring Data: The complete dataset is displayed, offering an initial overview of the sales data. 

3. User Input: Use the sidebar to select a specific store and date. This input will influence the data displayed in subsequent sections. 

4. Sections: Patterns, Trends, and Predictions: 

   - Patterns: View quarterly sales trends for each store in tabular form. Check average sales by year for the selected store. 

   - Trends: Identify overall sales trends over the years and visualize them with line charts. 

   - Predictions: Utilize the ARIMA model to predict future sales trends, including metrics like mean squared error and accuracy categorization. 

5. Conclusion: Conclude your analysis with insights gained and decisions made based on the app's results.
